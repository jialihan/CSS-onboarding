/* This allows properties to be set specific to each individual 
browser/rendering engine in order for inconsistencies between implementations to 
be safely accounted for. The prefixes will, over time, be removed (at least in theory) 
as the unprefixed, the final version, of the property is implemented in that browser.

To that end it's usually considered good practice to specify 
the vendor-prefixed version first and then the non-prefixed version, 
in order that the non-prefixed property will override the 
vendor-prefixed property-settings once it's implemented */
